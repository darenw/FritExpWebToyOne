SPREADSHEET for Fractionally Iterated Exponential, Szekeres Style
=================================================================


This spreadsheet calculates exp_u(x) for any u and x, hopefully correctly.

Enter values for x and u in the green boxes, top left.
Yellow boxes are important intermediate values.
Orange boxes show counts of exp, log, g, gbar going up and down the "mountains" of the calculation.
Blue boxes are values of the fractional part of u.

The box labeled "RESULT" is, of course, the result.

Accuracy is limited. As of Dec. 2022, is probably flawed, but seems to work okay based on 
a few quick examples.  I am not a spreadsheet expert!

I used Gnumeric http://www.gnumeric.org/  but expect this should work
just as well with Excel or any other commonly used spreadsheet program.
